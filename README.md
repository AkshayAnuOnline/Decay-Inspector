# Decay Inspector

Welcome to Decay Inspector: Taste with Trust, an innovative IoT-based food spoilage detection system designed to ensure food safety and minimize waste. This project utilizes advanced technologies, including Arduino Uno R3, MQ4 gas sensor, and ESP32-CAM, combined with Edge Impulse's machine learning capabilities to accurately monitor and detect food spoilage in real-time.

Decay Inspector leverages an MQ4 sensor to detect methane gas emissions, a key indicator of food spoilage, while the ESP32-CAM captures images of food items to provide nutritional information through software integration. The system processes data using Edge Impulse's FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects) model for precise object detection and classification. The real-time data is transmitted to Firebase, enabling seamless monitoring and data storage. Additionally, a Python-based software GUI is used for user interaction, displaying spoilage status and nutritional information. This project aims to promote food safety and reduce waste by providing timely and accurate spoilage detection.
