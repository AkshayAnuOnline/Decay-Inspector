# Decay Inspector
 Decay Inspector: Taste with Trust is an IoT-based food spoilage detection system that combines advanced sensors and machine learning to monitor food quality. Using an Arduino Uno R3 and an MQ4 sensor to detect methane levels, and an ESP32-CAM for food item recognition, the system sends data to a real-time Firebase database. Edge Impulse's FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects) model is employed to accurately identify and classify food items, enhancing the system's efficiency. This innovative solution provides a reliable method for assessing food spoilage, aiming to reduce food waste and ensure consumer safety.
